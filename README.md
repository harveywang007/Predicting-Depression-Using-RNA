# Stanford-CS-129-Project

For Stanford's CS 129 course, Applied Machine Learning, worked on a final project with two other classmates. These are my coding contributions.

In our project, we predicted depression based on RNA expression. The algorithms used included a neural network, logistic regression, SVM, and an anomaly detection algorithm; PCA was also tested, but it did not improve the performance. I wrote the anomaly detection and SVM algorithms, and I will share those here.

The data set was a proprietary set provided by one of the group members, so I will not be able to share it. The data included around only 120 samples, so the predictions are not accurate. The anomaly detection algorithm was the most successful, but only worked because of a shotgun approach.
